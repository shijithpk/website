## Hello, this is a simple dev blog.

This is a simple dev blog that I made [for my website](https://bennetthardwick.com).
It's quite easy to install, just go to the [project page](https://github.com/bennetthardwick/simple-dev-blog-zola-starter) and follow the prompts.

This template does some fancy stuff like [pre-rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content) blog posts and nav links,
pre-fetching your profile image and adding a bunch of common meta tags.
