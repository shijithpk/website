-YOU SHOULD HAVE A ONE-DAY COOLDOWN PERIOD AND THEN POST IT. READ THIS WITH FRESH EYES 
-HAVE MORE SUBHEADS, THERE NEEDS TO BE VISUAL RELIEF IN BETWEEN TOO
-WILL BE PEOPLE REALLY BE INTERESTED IN GOING INTO SO MUCH DETAIL INTO YOUR REASONGING FOR DOING THIS? WOULD THAT HAVE/BEAR/HOLD INTEREST FOR ANYONE ELSE?

* TLDR
    -DO THIS LAST AFTER YOU'VE WRITTEN THE FINAL DRAFT
    -DECIDE WHETHER YOU EVEN NEED THIS TLDR IN HERE
* SHOULD I HAVE AN OUTLINE OR TABLE OF CONTENT OF WHAT I'M GOING TO DO HERE?
    -Maybe have an outline, without being on the nose about it or making it so obvious that it's an outline

* who is this for
    * music obsessive
    * spotify obsessive
        * anyone using spotify playlists a lot
    * anyone wanting to use spotify as their sole interface/ALT/device for music discovery
    * amateur coders
    * life hackers
    * people wanting to automate aspects of their lives, wanting to save time
        * say you're inspired by thej and his blog, his attempts to automate everything

Just call this a personal project


When it comes to finding new music to listen to, my music discovery routine/mechanism/ALT consists of listening to spotify playlists, listening/ALT to online streams of radio stations, watching youtube videos of live performances etc. usually while i'm working or on the weekends. (SHOULD I GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT MY ROUTINE?) I love music, but lately i've been finding this routine/OTHER_WORD difficult to follow every week. Having to go to each individual website, forgetting that oh didnt go to livemusic.npr.com last week, so got to do it this week. Even the fact that i call it a 'routine' shows up/reveals/makes clear/ALT the fact that it is a chore/ALT, a sequence of steps I need to do every week. So i've decided to simplify my music discovery routine, make it less of a 'routine' by my collecting all the new music i should be listengin to in one playlist and sticking to that. Reduce those multiple steps into a single one. Stick to that one single playlist and just be happy with that. 

So what i've done is used/mined various playlists on spotify that go into new music released that week. These playlists from radio stations (liek KCRW in LA and KEXP in Seattle), music websites like Pitchfork and Line of Best Fit (UK) and more traditional/legacy publications like Rolling stone go into the new msuic thats been released that week or represetn the music the staff is listening to currently.

So these are plylists by websites, stations and publications that care about music and that are considered tastemakers / influencers in the US and UK. And by accumulating/hoarding/collecting all their choices in one playlist, i get to simplify my routine to just listening to this one playlist every week and reduced the time i have invest in/spend on/ALT discovering new music every week. Get recommendations from all these sources i respect in one place without having to visit them separately.

In other words, I'm aggreating the musical prefences of diffiernt websites and publications and distilling/consolidating/ALT it in this one playlist

Now if you are a spotify obsessive, one question that would be coming to mind is that spotify has its own playlists, ones that are curated by humans such as Rapcaviar for rap, Mint for dance music (CHECK IF I GOT THEIR COVERAGE RIGHT). And there are algorithmic playlists liek XXXX and XXXX. Not to mention the New Music Friday playlist, which is SPotify's most followed playlist (CHECK) acc to chartemetric/chartbeat/CHECK NAME and specifically covers new music released recent / recent releases. So, in a sense, why reinvent the wheel or go to this effort of duplicating what they're doing?

Except that this isnt really duplication. This comes about from me collecting the playlists choices of publiciation i respect and used to follow at tone point int time or still follow at present, are considered tastemakers, reflects or derives from or is based on my routine means that this consesnsus/playlist is something that is more reassuring to me.

So this isn't a slight/clink/dink/ALT on spotify's human curated playlists. I am aware on the peple headig the curation teams  that these playlists are professionally curated, that the people behind this take their work seriously. That if Spotify has hired them to be in this position, they know what they're doing (LINK TO MINT GUY PROFILE).

But dont know, guess i have a mental hangup about this (TAKE THIS OUT) but since these are brands that i know of/respect, i kind of trust their chocies more. (YOU'RE OVERSTRESSING THIS POINT, NEED TO WRITE LESS ABOUT THIS)

So who's recommending the music also matters in addition to what music is recommended. I amy end up not liking what these tastemakers recommendl, it wasnt recommended with/isnt catering to my musical tastes in mind at all, but i'll still want to listen to it. It's important for me to at least to have listend to these recommendations and then reject them, then to have never listened to them at all.

For these playlists, there is pre-existing or traditional authority to them that is outside/independent of the spotify eco-system. 

Am not particualry relying on algorithmic playlists like XXX and XX either for the same reasons. i've listened to the weekly algorithmic playlists they put out 'Discover Weekly' and 'Release Radar' once or twice, and the recommendations in them aren't bad. But the fact that dont have roots or derived form the choices of stations/publications/websites that were part of my music discovery routine in the past rules them out too. And that there is no superior authority or musicianship or criticship / RIGHT WORD which is being brought to bear here on these recommendations.

To be clear, I'm not exactly a 'down with algorithms' guy, that they are the 'curse/bane/downfall of humanity'etc.

If your fear/reluctance/ALT to use spotify comes out of the fear/ALT that you would be put in a musical bubble (GIVE LINK TO COMPLAINTS) where you contintue listengin to what you've listened before and are not exposed to different music, that ther's a sameness tot he music, then you could use this model/method/lifehack is one way to escape/avoid/ALT the clutch/grasp/ALT of algorithms. mining/aggregating plylists of tastemakers you respect to create the ideal playlist for yourself. Don't know much of a bubble you end up in, even if you do at present my view is that this lack of diversity/difference/ALT is correctable in algorithms/models/music being recommended.

If the concern is about htem minig/analysing/ALT your patterns in the first place, guess apple music is a better option, given how much they advertise/emphasize about how it's more about human curation for them. Though I don't know enough about apple music to say that it is any less data-collecty/intrusive/surveill-y/track-y. (DO I NEED THIS)

IMPLEMENTATION
The implementation/ALT of this will be basic for many developers, but if this will spur/encourage/ALT people to do something like this for their own music listening, 'incept' this idea in their heads (TOO INFORMAL LANAGUAGE), give them some kind of model to strcuture to follow or even improve on, make them think 'oh this is cool, i should do this too' and even improve on it in their own implmentation, or encourage others to talk about their own more sophisticated music discovery automation setups, this post will have done some good.

THe few other playlist creation tools that have come up in my search have been relying on spotify's own algorithms to poulate their playlists. For eg. this tool/website/ALT ask you to give a few seed artists, seed tracks etc. and then populate playlists based on those initial seeds. This other tool performs aggregation by seeing all spotify playlists that have the word 'acoustic' say somewhere in their title/description/metadata and combines all these tracks. The only issue is that , as far as i know, these are all one-time efforts, there is no effort to keep updating the playlist on a daily or weekly basis after its generated the first time. (GIVE LINKS TO Playlist minr, that github proejct etc.)

In choosing playlists to aggregate, i've tried to create a blance betwen american / british preferences and a balance of different genres. For the balance of different genres, i've used playlists for particular shows. For example, for world music (GET POLITICALLY CORRECT NAME), i've used a spotify playlist atht lists tracks for the Music PLanet show on BBC Radio 2/3/4 

PUT SCREENSHOT OF SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS 

Now i'm getting over 100 tracks a week, which seems like a lot, but it's easy to know whether a song is worth listening to or not in two minutes, i skip over a lot of music. Mostly, i just let it play in the background without being obsessed/anxious/pressured to get thourhg the list in a few hours, make it a chore for myself. If something grabs my attention, i just like it.

That's not so much of an issue as the fact that i end up liking very few of the songs that come my way. Out of the 110 songs that were there one week, i only ended up likeing 15 of them. The week after that it was 12 out of 127. Long term i want to fine tune this further by finding out which playlists give me tracks i end up liking and not liking, and in six months time, make an assessment, remove those playlists that aren't really giving me much to like and remove them if i can do without them. 

There is the danger of me bubbling/isolating/not exposing myself to different types of music if I do this. But if it turns out I never like the songs put out by a playlist, might as well remove it and replace it with a different playlist. And accept/admit/acknowledge/realise/ALT that my tastes are more solidified/reified/ALT -- and even more limited -- than i'd like to admit (GOING PERSONAL HERE, KEEP IT OR DISCARD?)

Further details about choices i made in my implementation are available in the script (GIVE LINK) and github repo.(GIVE LINK)

SCRIPT NOTES
    --Do the python script in such a way that anyone can do it starting afresh
    -- Generate the databases fresh in the script
    -- PUT IT BY LAST sorted by acousticness, expalin why you did so, that you have a preference for acoustic music, but explain this only in the script

README NOTES 
    - IMAGE HERE DESCRIBING MY PROCESS. DO I REALLY NEED IT? WHO'S GOING TO SEE THE README ANYWAY?
    -- provide csvs of main spotify playlists for each genre, for UK and US
    -- also playlist ids for hip-hop genre


6 music playlist -- needs to change
